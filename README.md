# NWN-EE-PHP-Serverstatus
Simple PHP Code to add the Server details from any NWN EE Server. It is done by using the given API from Beamdog.
Found at https://api.nwn.beamdog.net/v1/.

Yet only a prototyped small check, which I plan to be a banner and a more detailed scan.

Simply add your 'kxPublicKey' in the url at the top.
