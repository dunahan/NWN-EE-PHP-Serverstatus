# NWN-EE-PHP-Serverstatus
Simple PHP Code to add the Server details from any NWN EE Server. It is done by using the given API from Beamdog.
Found at https://api.nwn.beamdog.net/v1/.

Now it contains a better structurized small check, yet the banner for my persistant world. But it can easily changed to everyone's needs.

For a banner pic, add the url to the pic at line two.
Simply add your 'kxPublicKey' in the url at line four.

I provided a little code snippet in html to add it as a banner in html-snippet.html.


Here is a example for my persistent world...
